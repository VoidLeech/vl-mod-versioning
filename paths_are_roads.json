  "comment": "Thanks for reading this. Paths are Roads isn't actually a mod, so this update.json is purely for fun. Also the changelogs won't fully reflect what's on CurseForge, Modrinth, or Github, as I don't repeat the features that are new to 2.1.0 here if that was the first version available for a Minecraft version.",
